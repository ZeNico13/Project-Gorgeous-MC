‚ÑπÔ∏è **Informations**
- We are aware that the number of mobs appearing at night is greatly reduced in the Overworld. We are currently investigating this issue.
- Chunk Pregenerator has been removed as there is currently an important bug. Terrain and structures are generated correctly, but biomes and their distributions are not correct.
- Eerie Entities has been removed due to server performance problems.
