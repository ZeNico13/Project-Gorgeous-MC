‚ÑπÔ∏è **Informations**
- This update focuses on QoL improvements, optimization, and adjustments to the modpack.
- The loading time of the modpack has been significantly reduced following the removal of JEI Hider! You will notice a **reduction of about 45% in launch time**.
- The amount of RAM used by the modpack has been reduced, notably due to the removal of the debug mod Caliper! You will see a **reduction of around 1.2 GB in RAM usage**.
- After testing, Nothirium has been added to the modpack to replace OptiFine **if you are playing on Linux**. If you are playing on Windows, this addition has no impact, and installing OptiFine is still highly recommended!  
- Nether Portal Spread has been removed due to its negative impact on server performance.
- Nyx meteors have been disabled as they were hard to control in-game, destructive, and far too frequent. Additionally, meteors would massively accumulate in unloaded chunks, causing an endless meteor shower when players entered those chunks.
- For Simple Voice Chat, the default port has been changed to make the modpack server easier to set up and configure. However, if possible, it is recommended to change the port used by Simple Voice Chat (in the `voicechat-server.properties` file in the `config/voicechat` folder) to something other than the one used for the Minecraft server.
- The next major update to the modpack will focus on adding quests to the modpack.
